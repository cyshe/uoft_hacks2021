## Inspiration
Most of the expenses apps track personal expenses and do weekly reviews. We think there is a lack of motivation to save more since the period they track has passed. As a result, we decide to create an expense app where the user can know their spending in the current budgeting period

## What it does
The app is an expense app that shows how much of the budget is being used. Users can add and view transactions like a standard expenses app.

## How we built it
We built the app using flutter

## Challenges we ran into
Learning app development from scratch

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It's a working app!!!!!!
